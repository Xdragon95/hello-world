# hello-world
Guess I should write something here.  
Just a small-time speedrunner trying to figure out how to use this site.  
So this is the next line hopefully.  
Okay, I understand a bit more now, to do a line break I need to add two completely blank spaces at the end of a statement, like this.  
See? Then I can press enter and continue on the next line. I could also just continue writing things nonstop and eventually I'll get onto a new line. Hopefully...
